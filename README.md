# Vibration-Data-Analysis
This Repository is one of the ways of doing exploratory data analysis on the vibration data. It has a very basic analysis of Health Zones classifications using unsupervised learning methodology.This analysis can be helpful for those who knows basics about the descriptive analysis of any engineering sensors. This work is done in very less amount of time (1 Hour) but the main goal here is to introduce the sensor and vibration data analysis to a Newbie!!!
